# C-Clock
One of my first private code projects, a simple clock in C.

Yes, I mean it's a clock. Maybe someone will give me feedback for better efficiency. I know the project is very short, but sometimes there are more efficient code alternatives. I would appreciate feedback and suggestions for improvement etc.


This Egg-timer allows you to set a timer and after it expires a sound is generated (currently only on windows).
